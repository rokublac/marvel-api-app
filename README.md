# Marvel API Application
Small project to work with Marvel's RESTful API that delivers the a brief character information from a character search bar.
Not compatible with IE (maybe some others too, haven't really tested it), not 100% responsive and no mobile responsivness.

Things to be completed:
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness (don't even try and view it on mobile, it's a mess. Request the desktop site if you're on mobile)
- [ ] Cross browser compatibilty
- [ ] 100% Responsive design
